###Project Description
This project helps school students explore an interactive map of India, showcasing various types of soils, crops, and mountains. By using Folium and Streamlit, the map allows students to learn about different agricultural regions, soil types, and mountain locations with interactive features, enabling them to select and view relevant information easily.

###The Problem statement
School students often struggle to access accurate and easily understandable information regarding the geographical distribution of soil types, crops, and mountains across India. Searching for this data across multiple websites can be time-consuming and inefficient.

###The Solution
This project provides an interactive map of India, enabling students to explore various soil types, crops, and mountains through an intuitive platform. By using Folium and Streamlit, the map allows students to visually interact with and learn about the geographical and agricultural features, enhancing their understanding in a user-friendly and engaging manner.

!Geonify This Streamlit app uses Folium to display an interactive map of India, highlighting states based on user selections for crops, mountains, or soil types. Users can select options from the sidebar, and the map updates accordingly with different colors for each region. The app requires Indian_States.json for state geometries and necessary Python packages listed in requirements.txt.
